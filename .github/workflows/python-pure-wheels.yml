name: Build and publish pure python wheels
# Builds and publishes the pure wheels on pypi.
#
# This does not include the main `tket2-py` package, which is built using maturin.
# See `python-wheels.yml` for that workflow.
#
# When running on a release event or as a workflow dispatch for a tag,
# and if the tag matches `{package}-v*`,
# this workflow will publish the wheels to pypi.
# If the version is already published, pypi just ignores it.
