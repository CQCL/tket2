# Testing Circuit Equivalence Classes

ECCs used in the tket Badger optimizer.
See [EqCircClass](https://docs.rs/tket/0.16.0/tket/optimiser/badger/struct.EqCircClass.html).

Some eccs have been compiled using the rewrite compiler in `/compile-rewriter`.
See its [README](https://github.com/CQCL/tket2/blob/main/compile-rewriter/README.md) for more information.
