# `tket::portmatching::CircuitMatcher` precompilation

This folder contains a binary to compile sets of patterns into `CircuitMatcher`
objects, stored as binary files.
These binary files can then be loaded into TKET using `CircuitMatcher::load_binary`.

CircuitMatchers can be generated either from ECC files generated by Quartz, or from folders with
patterns in TK1 JSON format.

### Example use
To generate the circuit matcher that corresponds to the ECC stored in
`../test_files/T_Tdg_H_X_CX_complete_ECC_set.json`, run the following command
from this folder:
```
cargo run -- -i test_files/T_Tdg_H_X_CX_complete_ECC_set.json
```
This will generate a file called `matcher.bin` in this folder. See `cargo run -- -h` for more information.
