//! Rewriting strategies for circuit optimisation.
//!
//! This module contains the [`RewriteStrategy`] trait, which is currently
//! implemented by
//! - [`GreedyRewriteStrategy`], which applies as many rewrites as possible on
//!   one circuit, and
//! - Exhaustive strategies, which clone the original circuit and explore every
//!   possible rewrite (with some pruning strategy):
//!    - [`ExhaustiveGreedyStrategy`], which applies multiple combinations of
//!      non-overlapping rewrites.
//!    - [`ExhaustiveThresholdStrategy`], which tries every rewrite below
//!      threshold function.
//!
//! The exhaustive strategies are parametrised by a strategy cost function:
//!    - [`LexicographicCostFunction`] allows rewrites that do
//!      not increase some coarse cost function (e.g. CX count), whilst
//!      ordering them according to a lexicographic ordering of finer cost
//!      functions (e.g. total gate count). See
//!      [`LexicographicCostFunction::default_cx_strategy`]) for a default implementation.
//!    - [`GammaStrategyCost`] ignores rewrites that increase the cost
//!      function beyond a percentage given by a f64 parameter gamma.
