TKET2 is an open source quantum compiler developed by Quantinuum. Central to
TKET2's design is its hardware agnosticism which allows researchers and
quantum software developers to take advantage of its state of the art
compilation for many different quantum architectures.

`tket2` is available as a rust crate on [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/tket2) and as
a python package on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/tket2/).

See the respective
[Rust](https://github.com/CQCL/tket2/blob/main/rust/README.md) and
[Python](https://github.com/CQCL/tket2/blob/main/python/README.md) READMEs for
more information.
