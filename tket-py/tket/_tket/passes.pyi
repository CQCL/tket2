    HyperTKET's best attempt at optimising a circuit using circuit rewriting

    By default, the input circuit will be rebased to Nam, i.e. CX + Rz + H before
    optimising. This can be deactivated by setting `rebase` to `false`, in which
    case the circuit is expected to be in the Nam gate set.

    Will use at most `max_threads` threads (plus a constant). Defaults to the
    number of CPUs available.

    The optimisation will terminate at the first of the following timeout
    criteria, if set:
    - `timeout` seconds (default: 15min) have elapsed since the start of the
      optimisation
    - `progress_timeout` (default: None) seconds have elapsed since progress
      in the cost function was last made
    - `max_circuit_count` (default: None) circuits have been explored.

    Log files will be written to the directory `log_dir` if specified.
