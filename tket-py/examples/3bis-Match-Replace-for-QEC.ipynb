    "## Circuit transformation as graph rewriting\n",
    "\n",
    "The API that we discuss in this notebook can be used to express circuit transformation\n",
    "logic in terms of \"rewrites\", an approach that comes from graph transformation (aka rewriting) theory. You'll see -- this is cool and makes it very easy to express a wide\n",
    "range of circuit transformation strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three main concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The `Rewriter` is an object that takes a circuit as input and returns a bunch of `CircuitRewrite` objects as outputs. This step is \"read-only\" in the sense that it does not modify the input circuit at all.\n",
    "2. The `CircuitRewrite` objects describe potential circuit transformations that apply locally to a subcircuit of the input circuit. They can be stored and possibly combined together before being applied to the input circuit -- or they can be discarded, in which case, nothing happens to the input circuit.\n",
    "3. Finally, an `Optimiser` takes the set of `CircuitRewrite` produced by one or multiple `Rewriter` objects and finds the best sequence of rewrites to apply to the input circuit. This typically happens by trial and error: rewrites are applied and their effect on the cost function is evaluated. It is then up to the optimiser to decide whether to apply further rewrites on top, or backtracking and reverting the change to apply other rewrites instead.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's go through a simple example to illustrate these three concepts, using the rewriters and optimisers provided out of the box by TKET.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. The ECC Rewriter\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ECCRewriter` provides a fast way to generate rewrites that implement the typical commutation and gate cancellation rules on a given gate set. This is often useful as a basis for more complex rewrite strategies."

    "### Advanced features of matchers and replacers\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Matching extension ops\n",
    "\n",
    "The `match_tket_op` method will not work on ops that TKET does not recognise. By default, if an op that is not a typical TKET gate is encountered, it will be silently ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "To handle this case, the Matcher API provides the `match_extension_op` method:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class CircuitMatcher:\n",
    "    ... \n",
    "\n",
    "    def match_extension_op(\n",
    "        self,\n",
    "        op: CustomOp,\n",
    "        inputs: List[CircuitUnit],\n",
    "        outputs: List[CircuitUnit],\n",
    "        context: MatchContext,\n",
    "    ) -> MatchOutcome:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This method is called instead of `match_tket_op` if the op is not a typical TKET gate and the optype is passed as a `tket.ops.CustomOp`. Matching of such custom ops can be done using the name property of `CustomOp`. Note that unlike `TketOp`s, for which a single list of arguments is passed, when matching `CustomOp`s, the matcher API distinguishes between `inputs` and `outputs` arguments (as unlike typical quantum gates, there is no guarantee that they are identical).\n",
    "\n",
    "I highly recommend checking out the docs of `tket.protocol.CircuitMatcher` for more details on this API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Combining multiple matches to create a single rewrite\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to keep in mind some of the limitations/design choices of the Matcher API. The Matcher will start by matching a single operation, and then attempt to expand a match to form a larger subcircuit, appending new operations to the beginning or the end of the previously matched subcircuit. This means in particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The Matcher API only supports matching _connected_ subcircuits: from a single matching operation, an entire matched subcircuit is obtained by gradually expanding the boundary of the matched region.\n",
    "2. The matcher API will only let you match convex subcircuits: the optimiser will never extend a matched subcircuit to an additional operation if this would violate convexity. This gives you a guarantee that operations will be matched in a certain order (there won't be \"gaps\" during the matching process), but it is of course limiting in the expressivity of the matcher.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a specific rewriter designed to alleviate the first limitation above: `CombineMatchReplaceRewriter`:"

    "To recap, this brings the list of rewriters that we have seen to three:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `ECCRewriter`: generates rewrites that apply the typical commutation and gate cancellation rules for a given gate set.\n",
    "- `MatchReplaceRewriter`: combines a matcher and a replacer to create a new rewriter. The matcher and replacer can be chosen from the TKET-provided set of matchers and replacers, or custom ones can be implemented using the Matcher and Replacer APIs.\n",
    "- `CombineMatchReplaceRewriter`: similar to `MatchReplaceRewriter`, but allows you to combine multiple matchers to form subcircuit matches that are disconnected. The union of the matched subcircuits of the individual matchers will form the overall matched subcircuit that is passed to the replacer and used to construct the rewrite.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Using a custom cost function in `BadgerOptimiser`\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimiser used the default cost function so far, which is the number of CX gates. We can pass a custom cost function to be minimised. The cost function should be integer-valued, so a natural solution is to define a dict mapping op types to their cost.\n",
    "\n",

    "op_costs = { PyTketOp.CX: 1, PyTketOp.H: 2 }\n",

    "#### Example: Matching transversal Hadamards\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we are interested in pairing up Hadamard gates if they appear on qubits 2k and 2k+1 for some k. We can implement this by combining a matcher matching Hadamard on even qubits with a matcher matching Hadamard on odd qubits:"
